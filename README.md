# data-modeling-essentials-slides
These are Quarto slides for the Data Modeling Essentials lesson initially created by Carmen Galaz Garcia for the 2023 NCEAS - Delta Stewardship Council data training. 

Here I'm adapting the slides for NCEAS Learning Hub coreR course (October 2023 version)

The material associated with these slides is in our course book, found here: <https://learning.nceas.ucsb.edu/2023-10-coreR/session_07.html>
